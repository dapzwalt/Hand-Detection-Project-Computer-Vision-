## Overview
We leverage computer vision to iddentify and track hands in real-time using my webcam. This Project illustrates the use of Mediapipe as well as OpenCV Library.

## Project Structure
- Importing Necessary libraries: I imported two very important libraries for this project which are OpenCV and Mediapipe
- Identification Of Webcam: It then identifies your webcam either an inbuilt one or an external one.
- Processing of Image: The code we use helps to switch your webcam and converts the image from BGR to RGB required for Mediapipe
- Hand Detection with MediaPipe: The mediapipe library tracks and detect the hand landmarks. Th detected landmark are then visualized on the screen

 ## Usage
